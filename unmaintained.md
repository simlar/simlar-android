Simlar now unmaintained
=======================

Simlar has always been a personal passion project for me, something I have truly enjoyed working on since its inception in 2013. However, a few months ago I welcomed my son into the world and have decided to dedicate my free time to him.

While I will keep the servers running for now, I want to give a heads-up: If any major issues arise, I may need to shut them down without notice. In the meantime, I hope to find some time here and there to update the apps dependencies.

For the moment Simlar is still available (as always, at your own risk) but it is time to start exploring alternatives. Both <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> and <a href="https://element.io">Matrix</a> are doing an excellent job.

I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to the Simlar team - this project would not have been possible without you.

Sincerely,
 Ben Sartor
