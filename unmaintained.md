Simlar now unmaintained
=======================

Since its beginnings Simlar has always been a fun and free time project. I have enjoyed it a lot since 2013. But a few month ago my son was born and I want to dedicate my free time to him :)

I will keep the servers running for a while. But as soon as any bigger problems arise I might turn them off without warning.
Till then hopefully I will find the time to update the apps dependencies here and than.

So at the moment you may still use Simlar (like alway on your own risk). But it is time to look for an alternative. E.g. signal and matrix are doing a great job.

Thanks a lot to the Simlar team! Without you Simlar would not have been possible.

Sincerly,
Ben Sartor
